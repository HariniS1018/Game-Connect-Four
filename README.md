# Game-Four-Connections
------------------------
Welcome to Four connections game development repository! Connect Four is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a m-row, n-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. It is therefore a type of m,n,k-game (m,n,4) with restricted piece placement. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
